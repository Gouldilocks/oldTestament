# Kings
* Kings is about two kingdoms: Israel and Jerusalem
* Big Highlights: Elijah and Elisha
* The narrative of the book more closely follows traditional history. That is why we get some hard and fast dates for this time period
* Starting with the times in David and Solomon, we can start to use the Bible for history, because 3rd sources back it up.
### Saul
* The Amalekite who killed Saul
  * What was he doing on the Battlefield?
    * Most likely he was scavenging, but David claims that he had killed Saul after Saul asked to be killed (Serge does not think that is what happened. He thinks that David conspired to kill him and covered his tracks).
* Saul was one of the people who "magically" died while [David](###David) was rising to power

### David
* See the killing of [Saul](###Saul)


### Solomon
* First King in the book of kings. Descended from [David](###David)
Very hard to date events up until this point in history.
* Serge claims that he is NOT the writer of [Ecclesiastes](###Ecclesiastes)

### Jeroboam I
### Hezekiah
* Second king in the book of kings. Descended from David
### Manasseh
### Josiah
* Third King in the book of kings. Descended from David
* Finds the "hidden documents" and repents.
### Jehoiachin
### Sennacherib
### Nebuchadnezzar
### Cyrus
### Jeroboam II
### Darius
### Ahasuerus/Ahashverosh/Artaxerxes
### Zedekiah

# Prophets
### Amos
### Hosea
### Isaiah
### Jeremiah
### Ezekiel
### Jonah
* Jonah is one of the 12 minor prophets
* Very unique book, has a lot of comedic parts to it

* Jonah raises some serious issues according to Serge
  * __Serge__ Claims that this book is a book of things that have not really happened.
    * Evidence:
      * Nineveh was described to have taken him 3 days to go across it, when in reality it was really only a mile long. Why would it have taken him that long?
      * Also, why would the people of Nineveh listen to a random prophet from another land they don't care about?
      
  * Why would the Bible be telling us this story?
    * Some say it is about the power of repentance, but *SERGE DISAGREES*.
    * *SERGE BELIEVES* that the book is about Jonah himself.
    * Another argument that *Serge* gives is that the book is trying to give God a better image with this book, since previous books just show God's wrath, and Jonah shows (In a fairly comedic way actually) that *Anybody* can be saved if they repent, even if you don't like it.

* The name Jonah means TurtleDove
  * The turtle dove is a *sacrificial* animal.
  * Serge says that Jonah is the one sacrificing himself.
    * Why is it a sacrifice?
      * Because at the time of the books writing, Jerusalem had been sacked by Nineveh, and the book is set before that time. The sacrifice here is Jerusalem. That is also why it is shown that Jonah was so upset about them being spared. 
  * The book shows that God *Does* sacrifice the innocent for the sake of the sinner
### Zephaniah
* Has mixed messages of Doom and salvation
### Habakuk
### Zechariah
### Hananiah

# Other Biblical and Post-Biblical Characters
### Ishbosheth
### Joab
### Bathsheba
### Uriah
### Absalom
### Amaziah
### Ruth
### Naomi
### Boaz
### Esther
* Esther is the most hotly debated of the [Unholy Trinity](###UnholyTrinity)
* Even Martin Luther hated the book of Esther.
* There is no mention of God, Prayer, the commandments, the temp, the promised land, or even Israel.
* There are multiple versions of Esther:
  * Beta-Text
    * From the Septuagint
    * Only has additions
  * Alpha-Text
    * From the Masoretic Text
    * Had the same additions but also some stuff removed
  * Original Masoretic Text
    * The original story

  * They are different how?
    * Both have 6 additions. Between those additions, God is mentioned a ton. There is a lot of prayer and commandments mentioned.
    * It is clear that the text has an emphasis on what the original book was lacking.
    
  * *Looking at these, we can see a clear example of [Text Criticism](###TextCriticism)*
  
  * Big difference:
    * In these edited versions, Hamon comes earlier for his betrayal *Before* The new queen part.
    * This is because people had a problem with Esther intermarrying for self gain.
    * This way, the new story now shows that she was intermarrying just to save her people, not self gain.
  
  

### Mordechai
### Haman
### Lady Israel
* Personified as a woman in the song of songs and prophetic books
### Ezra
### Samuel
### Ecclesiastes
* Coined a "Self help book" by Serge himself
* Reflective / Speculative / Critical.
* Has a different view of wisdom than to that of Proverbs.
* Was *Not* Written by [Solomon](###Solomon) according to Serge himself.
  * Has some words that were in Persian, and he would not know that language, nor were the Persians around during Solomon's time.
  * Why would someone do that?
    * Because they want the ethos that Solomon's name attributes

* Why would Ecclesiastes be written after the exile?
  * Ecclesiastes raises the issue of [Theodicy](###Theodicy)
  
* What does Ecclesiastes say about God?
  * Try to enjoy what you have, since life will end. Make the most of it.

* Ecclesiastes and its implications about the commandments
  * Why do people violate the commandments? To gain something of course!
    * But if reaching for anything is meaningless, then why should we even violate the commandments.
    * Argument basically boils down to the fact that nothing is worth anything on this earth, thus you should only look to God for meaning.

* __Serge Claim___
  * Ecclesiastes had a lot of controversial / dangerous thoughts, and dumb people would not understand the real way to read it. So, someone added the very end of Ecclesiastes:
    * If you feel disturbed, just listen to the commandments
### Suffering Servant

### Messiah/Christ
### Father Mapple
### Teacher of Righteousness

# Concepts, Terms, Scholars, Authors
## Criticisms
### Text Criticism
* Definition: Comparing different manuscripts and trying to figure out why they are different.
* Useful for:
  * Figuring out if there are mistakes in the scripture
  * By comparing different versions, we can learn more about each version
  * Example: [Esther](###Esther)
### Structural Criticism
### Redaction Criticism
### Historical Criticism
### Reader-Response Criticism

## Terms
### Wisdom Literature
* There is no structure / order
* Think of it as to like an accumulation of things
* Similar to how we view phonebooks or dictionaries
* Similar to how the Kuran was written.
* 
### Triangulation
* The idea of triangulation is that you should have a 3rd source whenever you want to verify the integrity of a source. We want something to verify the text and to "get our bearing" so to speak.
### Rhetoric
### Actualization
### Allegorization
### Theodicy
* Answers the question of: Why is this world made by God, created by God, organized so poorly?
  * This is basically the idea of apologetics.
  * It is clear that Serge believes this term should mean when people went back to the Bible and edited it in order to make it more appropriately match their views. I don't buy it, but thats what he believes clearly.
### Davidic Promise
### Deconstruction
* Put into gaps things that the author did not want you to think about
  * Reading against the grain so to speak

* Ex)
  * 1 Samuel 15 - 2 Samuel 8
    * This is the history of [David's](###David) rise
      * Commonly knowwn to be Apologetics, since it appears to be trying to justify something in the Bible.
      * This is a hypertext
### Symbolic Action
### Unholy Trinity
* The unholy Trinity is the name Serge coined for the 3 books of the Bible that do not mention God, the commandments, or any of the sacraments. They are:
  * [Esther](###Esther)
  * [Ecclesiastes](###Ecclesiastes)
  * [Song of Songs](###SongOfSongs)
  
* We know that there were debates about if they should be in the Bible.
### Alpha-text
### Beta-text
### Deuternonomistic History
### Mysticism
### Succession Narrative/Court History
### "Stories"
### Didactic
* The genre that is all *instructions or teachings*
* Proverbs is Didactic
  * The opposite type of writing is like the writings in Job or [Ecclesiastes](###Ecclesiastes)
### reflective/speculative/critical
### Deutero-Isaiah
### Typology


## People
### Stefan Heym
### Claude Levi-Strauss
### Martin Noth
### William F. Albright
* Coined the term [Historical Criticism](#HistoricalCriticism).
### History of David's Rise
* As we move on in the story, everyone who stands in the way of [David](###David) just dies.
  * We do not know if he was in any way involved.
  * Would a "Man after God's own heart" be able to secretly murder people?

* We know for a fact that he had Uriah killed after sleeping with his wife.
  * Here David commits multiple crimes:
    * Adultery - with Bathsheba
    * Conspiracy - to murder
    * Breach of faith - betrays his faithful soldier
    * *All of these were punishable by death*
    
  * *David is treated in a __Special__, and an __Exclusive__ way different to that of [Saul](#Saul)
### Wolfgang Iser
